# Schedule Your Consultation

Choose a time that fits your schedule. We’ll tentatively hold your appointment while we perform a quick, manual conflict check to ensure we can ethically proceed. No payment is requested until that review is complete.

## Before You Book

- Manual Conflict Review (no payment until cleared)
- Payment Link by Email (LawPay)
- Questionnaire by Email/MyCase (≥24 hours before consult)

## Choose a Time

## What Happens Next

After you book, check your email. If we clear conflicts, we’ll send your payment link and questionnaire with a quick list of what to prepare. If we identify a conflict, we’ll notify you and cancel the appointment.

## Need Help?

If the calendar doesn’t load or you prefer to book by phone, call us and our team will help you schedule.
