# How Our Process Works

We keep the process straightforward: choose a time, we complete a quick conflict check, you pay once cleared, and you complete a short questionnaire so we can prepare. Then we meet for 90 minutes and deliver a written action plan within 24–48 hours.

## Step 1 — Pick a Time (Calendly)
[[Explain tentative hold; no payment requested yet]]

## Step 2 — Manual Conflict Check
[[Explain purpose, outcomes: clear/flagged; ethics; notification]]

## Step 3 — Payment via LawPay (Emailed Link)
[[Explain secure link and timing]]

## Step 4 — Pre‑Consult Questionnaire & Documents
[[List what helps; request ≥24h completion]]

## Step 5 — 90‑Minute Virtual Consultation
[[Outline agenda and expectations]]

## Step 6 — Written Action Plan (24–48 hours)
[[Describe content of plan and how to use it]]

## Timelines & Policies
[[Reschedule guidance; refunds summary]]

## Confidentiality & Guarantee
[[Plain language on confidentiality and satisfaction]]
