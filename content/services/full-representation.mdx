# Full‑Scope Family Law Representation

Some cases require comprehensive, end‑to‑end support—especially when disputes are complex, stakes are high, or cooperation breaks down.

## When Full‑Scope Makes Sense
[[High‑conflict parenting, complex property, contested spousal maintenance, enforcement]]

## Retainer & Billing
[[Trust retainer; billed work against retainer; clarity and updates; manual conflict check before payment]]

## Onboarding & Communication
[[Document checklist, key dates, phased strategy, communication cadence]]

## Call to Action
If your matter needs comprehensive advocacy, schedule a 90‑minute consultation.
